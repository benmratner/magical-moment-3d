<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Magical Moment 3D Imaging is an independently owned and operated service, providing customers an opportunity to see their unborn child via true-to-life images generated by the latest in 3D ultrasound technology.&nbsp;<br /> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We believe that real-time, high-quality images can jump-start the formation of that lifelong bond between parents and their baby. Unlike with traditional 2D ultrasound imaging, our service provides parents with an astonishingly life-like representation of their child's face. Even more, we can share with you, in real-time, the experience of seeing your baby yawn, cry, smile, swallow &amp; even blink for the very first time!&nbsp;</span></p>
